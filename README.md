# Sparv test on Ray

`requirements.txt` contains the Sparv dev-version and not https://pypi.org/project/sparv-pipeline/, 
because of issues with the latest release of Sparv.

The files in `config` are generated by `sparv setup -d "./sparv"`, and commited to this repo
to avoid installing Sparv locally and in the cluster.

`python sparv/run_ray.py` will submit a job for running one of the example corpora.
